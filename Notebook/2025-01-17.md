## Course content

- Linux is a beast!

### Real time systems

- Real time
  - Real devices, ~in deployment, kinda
- Real time systems
  - **Deterministic** response times
  - ~Time between the delivery and start of execution
  - ~Time between the output and input
  - Response time is between input and output
  - Not to be confused with critical; Real time may not be critical, but still be time important
  - Time criticalness vs importance
- OS has to be deterministic in the first place to allow applications to be deterministic
  - Poses a few restriction on the design of the OS
- Late answer is wrong answer
  - Time bound
- Deadlines
  - Hard deadlines
    - Cannot miss
  - Soft deadlines
    - Performance degrations occurs if missed
  - Firm deadlines
    - Can miss occasionally
  - Input driven deadlines
    - Relative to an input
    - Input triggers the activity
  - Time driven deadlines
    - Based on timers
    - Time triggers the activity
  - Mixed possible
    - ~Like Big-Little architechture
    - Big handles main things, Little takes care of interrupts when Big is busy, say
- Linux implements virtual memory
  - Everything need not be in RAM
