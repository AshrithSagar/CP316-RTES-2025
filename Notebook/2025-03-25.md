## `CMSIS OS2` overview

- Kernel
  - `osKernelInitialize`
  - `osKernelStart`
  - `osKernelLock` / `osKernelUnlock` / `osKernelSuspend` / `osKernelResume`
- Threads
  - `osThreadNew`
  - `osThreadGet`
  - `osThreadYield`
- Timers
  - `osTimerStart`

## Inter-control task flow

- Semaphore
  - Counting semaphore
  - Binary semaphore
- Mutex
- Flags
- Flag events
- Message queues
- Memory pools

- Thread flag
  - Each thread has an associated thread flag

## Priority inversion

- A lower priority task runs, acquiring some resource
- A higher priority task runs later, which also needs the same resource, but is kept to waiting since the lower priority task has already acquired it
- Meanwhile, a middle priority task interrupts, that doesn't use this resource, and the scheduler has to switch to it, since it's priority is higher than the lower one.
- This causes both the higher and the lower priority tasks to wait for the middle one to complete.
- The way this problem is approached is that in the short duration when context switch happens, temporarily the lower priority task's priority is kept same as the higher one, i.e., the lower priority tasks's priority is inverted for a short duration.
- This is so that when the scheduler runs after realising that the higher priority task cannot complete, the context is switch to the lower priorty one, so that it finishes using with the resource
- After which, the higher priority one runs, then the middle priority one
- The time taken just to run the higher priority task now also includes a part of the lower priority one, so that needs to be factored in profiling
