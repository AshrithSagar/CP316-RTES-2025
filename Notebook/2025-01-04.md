  - ~ executable, or relocatable,
- `arm-none-eabi-*`
  - `arm` $\implies$ ARM
  - `none` $\implies$ Bare metal; ~No target;
  - `eabi` $\implies$ EABI standard
- `arm-none-eabi-*`
  - `arm-none-eabi-gcc`
  - `arm-none-eabi-ld`
  - `arm-none-eabi-size`
  - `arm-none-eabi-objcopy`

## Stages of compilation

### Preprocessing stage

- `.c` $\rightarrow$ `.i`
  - High level language $\rightarrow$ ~Simplified format
  - Both are human readable formats, i.e., ~internally in ASCII
- Macros defined with `#define` are replaced in the `.i` file
- Conditional compilation also possible

### Compilation stage

- Compilers
  - `gcc`, `clang`, etc
- Compiler optimisations
  - `-o1`, `-o2`, `-o3`
  - `-o3` $\rightarrow$ Highest level of optimisation
- Each function is kept in a separate section, so that linker can do optimisations later on
  - Such as to skip unused functions

### Linking stage

- Resolves addresses
  - Give absolute (actual) addresses, to the previously relative addresses and offsets that were used
  - Relocatable addresses $\implies$ linker can place anywhere
- Symbol table
  - Defined entries
- Relocation table
  - Pending entries
- Changing the order of passign the object files to be linked may cause a different program (in terms of how the contents are organised) to be generated but functionally equivalent
- `.ld`
- `.map`

## Questions

- In the script files, you don't need shebang here?
- If `#ifndef` directive not used while including, how is the content duplication handled?
