- Project
- Line follower
- Collision detection using accelerometer
- Radio interface
- Bluetooth
  - Will prolly take a lot of time
- Create a ROS node
- Once a ROS node is setup up, can write higher wrappers in C++ or Python
- Can start with a round-robin scheduler
- Multi-threading
- Implement
  - Receive a command from UART port, to set speed: `0.0` for least, `1.0` for highest, whichever way
  - Using encoder interrupts, get odometry data, and calibrate movements
  - Publish the position and orientation
- From encoder information, calculating angular speeds, then linear speed, and so on
- Counters in encoder $\implies$ Angular delta $\implies$ Since wheel diameter known $\implies$ Linear distance travelled can be calculated
- Pulse per minute
- Can implement higher level commands
- Input can be in the form `speed, 0.5, 0.5`
- Print `x, y, theta` odometry data
  - All equations and calculations after that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{PPR} = N
\\
\Delta \theta = \frac{\Delta D}{B}
\\
\frac{2 \pi n}{N} D = d
\end{aligned}
