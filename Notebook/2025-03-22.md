- Project
- Line follower
- Collision detection using accelerometer
- Radio interface
- Bluetooth
  - Will prolly take a lot of time
- Create a ROS node
- Once a ROS node is setup up, can write higher wrappers in C++ or Python
- Can start with a round-robin scheduler
- Multi-threading
- Implement
  - Receive a command from UART port, to set speed: `0.0` for least, `1.0` for highest, whichever way
  - Publish the position and orientation
- From encoder information, calculating angular speeds, then linear speed, and so on
