## Context switch

- NVIC: Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller
- PendSV: Pendable SuperVisor call
  - Always lowest priority
  - An exception
  - Called from the ISR
  - Always run scheduler here
    - ~ Job is to run the scheduler, context switch and return
- Inter-task communication objects
  - Thread lines
  - Semaphores
    - Like a flag
- ~ Each task has a wait and priority
- Status: wait, ready
- SVC, ~supervisor call

- ~ Any exception handler will trigger SVC, causing the SVC handler to run, and context is switched appropriately
- Each system call has a system call number
- `flag_wait`
  - If flag is already set, return immediately
  - If not, then wait, causing a state change
- Each thread can be in a state: running, waiting, ...
- Whenever creating a task
- In RTOS, OS is not involved if it doesn't have to, hence the efficiency
  - Eg: When entering input through command line, os state changes only when `\n` is entered; all characters sent till then are sent to a buffer, and OS is not involved here.
- ~ Semaphore, is more like one-to-one
  - ~ Semaphore queue
- Pipelines
  - Multiple structure possible, where fetch, decode and execute can happen over multiple cycles
  - Simple/Single pipleline, where fetch, decode and execute all happen in one cycle
- ~ ARM in general calls core exceptions and interrupts, as exceptions
- Exception level priority is handled by the hardware.
- `TCB[n].priority`, `TCB[n].state`, `TCB[n].sp`
  - Priority, state and stack pointer

- As tasks are created, for each task a stack is created, and initial context is populated
  - ~ The stack frames differ in PC, SP
- At the end of creating a task, run the scheduler
- Client-server model
- `osKernelInit()`
  - All OS data strucures are initialised in an unintialised system

```c
main()
{
  osKernelInit();
  threadCreate();
  osKernelStart();
}
```

- `tcreate`
  - Function
  - Priority
  - Stack size
  - Arguments
- `osKernelStart`
  - Any OS call, first goes to SVC
  - Get the highest prioerty ~task/thread, and load it's SP, and perform context switch, and run

## Thread functions in CMSIS-OS2

- Creation and termination

  ```c
  id = osThreadNew(func, arg, attr);
  osThreadTerminate(id);
  ```

- Priority and scheduling

  ```c
  priority = osThreadGetPriority(id);
  osThreadSetPriority(id, priority);
  osThreadYield();
  osThreadSuspend(id);
  osThreadResume(id);
  ```

- Handling same priority tasks
  - ~ OS can decide to do round robin
  - Application programmer can decide what happens
- ~ Application decides whether a flag needs to be set or not

## Tasks

- a.k.a. threads
- A mechanism to share CPU amongst different applications
- A task is a function with an independent asynchronous thread of execution
- Each task thinks it has the entire CPU for itself
- Control is given from one task to another with/without the task's knowledge
- Operating system schedules task
- Scheduler has a scheduling algorithm; the most prevalent one is pre-emptive priority scheduling

---

- Scheduler is like a secretary; ~Not powerful enough like, say a boss.
- When `PendSV_handler` is run, stack frame is not touched, since still in ~exceptio context
- PCB: Process control block
  - Has lots of other things
  - File status, etc
- ~~TCB part of linux kernel as well

- Tasks are asynchronous
  - ~ There is no way stack frames can be shared

## Context switch

- Task 1, exception, SysCall handler, scheduler, context switch, Task 2

### Mutual exclusion

- Tasks can be ~pre-empted even in their critical regions
- If anoter task is using the same resources that were used by a ~ pre-empted task, then the new task has to wait for the ~ semaphore to be released first, even if the new task has higher priority.

### Synchronisation

### Data flow

- Consumption and production happen at different scales
- Need a message queue, and memory protocol
  - Need a mechanism to allocate and deallocate memory
  - `malloc`

### Timers

- Since time-driven dealines, need timers

## RTOS at a glance

- Job is to provide multi-tasking capabilities on a single ~processor.

---

- Scheduler has two variables, old task tid and new task tid
- If both are equal, no context switch is required, and directly return shoudl be fine.

## Miscellaneous

### Semaphores

- A synchronization object that controls access to a resource by multiple threads
- Two primary operations
  - Wait (P / Down operation)
    - Decrease the semaphore value
  - Signal (V / Up operation)
    - Increase the semaphore value
- Binary semaphores/ Mutexes
  - Value can be either 0 or 1
  - Used for mutual exclusion
- Counting semaphores

### Supervisor call (SVC)

A mechanism that allows user-level applications to request services from the operating system kernel in a controlled manner.

Each exception or system call triggers the SVC, which calls the `SVC_handler`, which might perform context switch, or run, etc

### Task Control Block (TCB)

- ~ Holds information about tasks, such as priority, state and stack pointer
