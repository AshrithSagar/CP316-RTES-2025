## Linux architecture

- Embedded system architecture with Linux
- Embedded Linux architecture
  - Managing memory
    - Virtual memory
    - Each application thinks it has the entire memory to itself
  - Networking
- Linux development environment
  - Linux is a modular kernel
  - Can add extensions to it
- Main striking features
  - ...
  - Real-time OS: Context switching
  - Linux: Virtual memory

## Linux systems

- Firmware
  - Boot order, etc
  - Loads the Pre-Bootloader
  - In ROM
  - Can only pull memory chunks (?)

- Pre-Bootloader, if required, if Bootloader too large
  - Some small code to initialise memory, etc, ~ until Bootloader takes over
  - When loading, no access to an `fs`, instead pulls through some memory blocks / partition; Through sectors

- Bootloader
  - System initialisation
  - Loads OS into memory
  - ~ From some secondary memory
  - Unlike startup code, clears from memory after use
  - Eg: GRUB

- Kernel
  - Base kernel + Extentible modules
  - Kernel initialisations
    - Process management
      - Core of the kernel
    - Memory management
      - Core of the kernel
    - File subsystem
      - ~ APFS, FAT, exFAT, etc (?)
    - Protocols
      - WiFi, Bluetooth, TCP/IP, etc
    - Device drivers
  - ~ Organised into modules
    - Constructors from OOPs paradigm

- Root file system
  - Standard applications
    - BASH
      - `ls`, `cp`, etc are programs
  - Specific applications
    - GUI, Networking, etc
  - Filesystems can be stored in a ZIP and flashed, to save space

- Variants
  - Even kernel can be TCPed from a network, without an OS

- Priorities need to be set by the system, not the application
  - Applications setting priorities doesn't serve the purpose, since they can always set high priorities
- Demand paging
  - Applications are allocated pages in memory, on demand
    - ~ Entire application is not loaded usually
  - Storage acts like an extension to RAM
    - After all the system allocations, the rest of the memory (RAM) is divided into pages, and allocated
  - Applications, such as shell, apps, etc
- Flash
  - Firmware, Loads bootloader from storage
  - Mapped in the processor address space
  - Direct access
- Caching
  - Cache, is essentially a RAM with a controller
  - Meant for ~ keeping in store/memory, for fast access
  - Cache memory doesn't have addresses of it's own
  - More like a look-up table, analogous to storing favorites
  - RAM to Cache is usually fast, but there is still a factor of speed
  - On the other hand Storage to RAM is slower
  - What to store and what to cache is determined based on some policy
    - LRU: Least recently used
- Memory mapping
  - Mapping $\to$ Allocating a range of the address space
  - Bus architecture: Address bus, data dus, control bus
  - Storage is not memory mapped. Can be mapped though, ~ but not done
- MMU
  - Memory management unit
  - ~ Virtual memory
- Not too bothered with the determinism of Linux
- Categories of real-time ness
  - Hard real-time
    - No chance to miss deadlines
  - Soft real-time
    - Can miss deadlines, sometimes
  - Firm real-time
    - Most of the times hits the deadlines, when missed, workarounds avaiable
    - ~ Linux

### Bootloader

- Needs to support multiple boards; Universal bootloader, hence the complexity
  - ~ Can load any OS, any `fs`
- In ROM
- Has it's own `fs`
- Loads OS in system memory (RAM)
- OS need not be store contiguously, bootloader picks up the pieces and loads in to RAM
- After compilation, a single executable `/boot/vmlinux`, and many KOs (Kernel objects)
  - KOs can be added as required
  - In embedded configurations:
    - `vmlinux` $\to$ `uImage` $\to$ `zImage` (compressed and stored) $\to$ In kernel
    - Flashed in factory
  - In laptops, usually a ~ chunk already / compiled already (?), as images (?)

### Operating system (Kernel)

- OS is synonymous with kernel
- Has it's own `fs`
- ~ SDIO, similar to GPIO

### RootFS (FHS)

- ~ Information structure, nothing runs here at this level

```plaintext
/bin : User command binaries
/boot : Static files for bootloader
/dev :
/etc :
/home : User home directories
/lib : Kernel ~binaries
/media : Mount points for removable media
/mnt : Temporary mount points
/opt : Add-on software packages
/root : Home for root user
/sbin : Binaries required by system admin
/tmp : Temporary files
/usr : User binaries; bin, include, lib, src, local
- /usr/bin: Compiler libraries
- /usr/include:
- /usr/lib:
- /usr/src:
- /usr/local: User local
- /usr/X11: Graphics
/var : System data storage
- logs, cache
```

- Linux distros: Organisation styles differs, although same kernel
- Kernel execution
  - Flash
    - bootcode
    - kernel
    - rootfs
  - RAM
    - Monolith kernel + Device drivers
    - RAM file system : Apps
    - Page frames
