## Real time operating systems (RTOS)

- `while (1)` systems
  - Simple and efficient with minimal overheads
  - Although long tasks may cause some bottlenecks
  - ~ Spaghetti code
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code
- RTOS systems
  - Multi-tasking capabilities
  - Overlapping response times possible, instead of restricting to sequential response times
- Systems
  - Polling systems
  - Interrupt driven systems

### Interrupt service routine (ISR)

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_handler
- https://www.realdigital.org/doc/a4c58d82eb0b52f4682bccde59defb62
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-isr-and-function-call/
- A function that runs automatically whenever an interrupt is generated

- Multiple sequential activities
  - The slow task becomes a bottleneck
    - The response time is determined by the slowest task in the sequence

  - ~ There is no priority that can be assigned in case of urgencies

### Multitasking

- ~ Context switches
- Tasks $\equiv$ Threads, synonymous

### Preemptive priority scheduling

- RTOS scheduling becomes very important especislly for tasks that are too long to be implemented in the ISR, and too late to implement in a main loop.

- Use of buffers

#### SVC

- Supervisor call (SVC)
- SVC handler
- Hardware pushes the registers into stack
- SVC is kept as a software interrupt
- ~ When a program in user space needs to access a system call

#### PendSV

- When returning from an ISR

#### NVIC

- Nested vectored interrupt controller

### Preemptive multi-tasking

- Scheduler
- ~ Context is saved whenever there is an interrupt?
  - ~ Switching happens only when needed?

---

- OS has file system, networking, external memory?, virtual memory, device drivers etc
- RTOS mainly is for it's scheduler; a very small kernel

---

- Sytems with RTOS
  - Divides asynchronous activities into tasks
  - Provide priorities

- Doing it this way allows for deterministic response times
- RTOS doesn't implement virtual memory
  - Unfragmented
  - ~ Designed in a way to allow for memory to run out

---

- RTOS is like a library, allowing for task creation and scheduling
- Inter-task communication
- Semaphores
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)
- Synchronisation and mutual exclusion
- Allows the application to handle the interrupts and devices directly
- In a way, OS mostly doesn't bother about any interrupts, except maybe Systick, and SVC

---

- Low priority tasks are preempted by the ~scheduler
- ~ Execution always starts when returning from some ~interrupt call

- ~ Task create, creates contexts for the tasks
  - ~ When the scheduler calls a task, the context is switched to the ~pre-allocated context
- Context
  - Only the local data and ~registers are part of the context
  - Global variables and instructions need not be

---

- Mutual exclusion
- Synchronisation
- Semaphores
- Flags

- Components of an RTOS
  - Threads
  - Scheduler

- Flow
  - Startup code
  - Startup task
  - Scheduler
    - Tasks

### Development model

- OS is quite modularised
  - App
  - System calls
  - Driver
  - Hardware
- RTOS is like a single system
- OS is more about fairness, etc

### Memory map

- Execution from ROM

#### ROM map

- Startup code
- RTOS code
- Startup task
- Application tasks
- ISRs
- `.rodata`
- `.data` values

#### RAM map

- `.data`
- `.bss`
- Task-1 stack
- Task-2 stack

- Memory protection
  - ~ Avoiding access to certain memory regions

---

- RTOS objects
  - Pre-emptive priority scheduler
  - Threads (tasks)
  - Mutual exclusion (mutex)

---

- Time slicing
- Round robin scheduling
