## Semaphore in CMSIS OS2

- Scheduler is called whenever there is a state change
- Pre-emptive scheduling
  - OS runs the highest priority thread which is ready
- Synchronisation, and mutual exclusion
- A binary semaphore is like a flag
- A counting semaphore is lika a set of tokens
- Interrupt is the only way through which a pre-emption happens
  - Round-robin scheduler, or time slicing, or hardware interrupt, etc
  - Systick interrupt, in case of round-robin scheduler
  - IRQ interrupt, in case of some hardware interrupt
  - ~ osDelay, etc; Timeouts
- Hardware takes over, stores a bunch of registers, and looks up vector table, and loads that value in the PC
- `sid = osSemaphoreNew(max_count, initial_cout, attr);`
  - max_count: number of resources
    - 1: for synchronisation
    - n: for mutual exclusion with n resources

- PendSV advantages
  - ~ Handlers need not call scheduler again and again, helpful
- Mutex vs binary semaphore
  - Recursion context
  - Mutex allows same thread to acquire multiple times
  - ~Also keeps tracks of ownership

- Semaphore for mutual exclusion

  - SVC handler
  - PendSV

- Semaphore for synchronisation

  - A producer and consumer
  - Runs one after another

- Semaphore implementation

  - Acquire

    ```c
    if (s.tokens > 0)
      s.tokens--;
    else
      s.enque(cur_tid)
      cur_tid.state = waiting
      schedule and context switch
    ```

  - Release

    ```c
    next_tid = s.deque();
    if (next_tid == none) // empty
      s.tokens++;
    else
      next_tid.state = ready
      schedule and context switch
    ```

- For atomic operations at OS level, OS uses `__disable_irq()` and `__enable_irq`

- Event flags

  - A group of $N$ flags
  - Consumer can wait for a combination of flags

- Thread flags
  - One flag per thread
  - Actions similar to event flag
  - No need to create or delete
  - In CMSIS OS2
    - `osThreadFlagsSet(thread_id, flags)`
    - `osThreadFlagsWait(flags, options, timeout)`
