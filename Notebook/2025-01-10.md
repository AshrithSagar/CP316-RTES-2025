## Overview of ARM Architecture

- As far as this processor is concerned, RO, RI and ZI are all ~same

- Execution unit

  - Registers unit
    - Core registers
      - Temporary locations where data is copied from the memory and operated upon
      - Inside the processor
  - ALU unit
    - Arithmetic Logic Unit
    - Digital circuits inside
  - LSU unit
    - Load Store Unit
    - Memory operations

- Memory mapped registers

- RISC processor

  - Efficient
  - ~Single responsibility principle

  - Fetch Decode Execute

  - ~CISC may perform operations within memory itself?


### Instructions

- Opcode, Registers

- Encodings: 16, 32

- ARM Cortex processors

  - Cortex-A
  - Cortex-R
  - Cortex-M

- ARM Cortex M4f

  - `f` $\implies$ floating point unit


### ARM architecture

#### Application-level programming model

- Registers and execution state
- Instruction set
- Memory model

#### System-level programming model

- Modes and privileges
- Exceptions, faults and interrupts
- Systick timer
- NVIC interrupt controller

  - ARM architecture reference manual

## Software timers

- Alignments
  - Address & data bus is 32 bit, that's why usign RISC can bring efficiency
  - Packed structure, in Networks

### Systick timer

- Part of ARM Cortex-M architecture
  - ARM is a chip designer, not manufacturer
- Countdown from a preloaded value to 0
- On reaching 0, it sets a flag, reloads the preloaded value, and optionally sends an interrupt
- 24-bit timer $\implies$ Maximum count is $\texttt{0x00FFFFFF}$, i.e., $2^{24} \approx$ 16 million
  - $\texttt{0x00FFFFFF} \to \texttt{0x00000000}$
- Runs at the processor speed

#### Programming model

- Memory mapper registers, `CVR`, `RVR`, `CSR`
- Current value register `CVR`
  - Current count
- Reload value register `RVR`
  - Value to load when count reaches to 0
- Control and status register `CSR`
  - Timer: Enable / Disable; `bit 0`
  - Clock source: Internal / External; `bit 2`
  - Flag, indicating whether timer has reacher to 0; `bit 16`
  - Interrupts: Enable / Disable; `bit 1`

#### Usage

##### Free running mode

##### Polling

---

- `volatile` keyword
- Any write into `CVR` clears it
- Code profiling
  - `tic`, `toc`
- Maximum milliseconds measurable with a 24-bit timer is $\approx 250 \text{ ms}$
- $64000 * \text{ms} \implies$ Milliseconds delay
  - $64 \text{ MHz} \implies 64$ clock cycles in $1 \ \mu\text{s} \implies 64000$ clock cycles in $1 \text{ ms}$
