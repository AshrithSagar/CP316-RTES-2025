## Mutex

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)>
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion>

- Problems without using mutex
  - Busy wait
    - Priority issues
    - Busy wait is a highest priority thread, context switch doesn't occur/ not implemented in this case
    - System will never switch to a lower priority task because of this
    - Analogy: ($\sim$) Boss keeps checking on employe whether task is done or not repeatedly. Employee spends most of the time reponding to that instead of working on the task.
  - Atomicity
    - <https://wiki.osdev.org/Atomic_operation>
- Mutex is a mechanism which provides
  - Atomicity in testing and setting a flag
  - A way to inform the OS that a task is waiting for a resource
- Mutual exclusivity
- Operations on a mutex
  - *Acquire* a mutex to get permision to get into a critical region
  - *Release* a mutex
- If flag is not available, state change occus, from running $\to$ waiting

### Mutex in CMSIS OS2

```C
osMutexID_t m;

m = osMutexNew(NULL);

osMutexAcquire(m, timeout);

osMutexRelease(m);
```

- Priority inversion
- Critical in this context doesn't refer to time critical or important, but rather that a shared resource is being used

---

- `count++` is not atomic
  - Meaning that it ~is split over multiple instructions, ~in assembly level
- `(void *)` is a generic pointer

---

- Mutex is a data structure, with a flag and a queue
  - First time mutex is acquired, the flag is available, and set to 0; Queue is empty
  - Second time when the mutex is acquired, flag is unavailable, so task is enqueued and task status is changed to wait.
  - While releasing, it's the reverse order
  - Pop the queue, in order; and if empty, set flag to available
- Mutex is a semaphore, with a ~few additions
  - Can be recursively acquired
    - Also keeps the owner in addition to flag and queue
  - Only the owner can release
    - Also need to match the number of acquires and releases
- Semaphore also has a flag and queue
- ~ Priority queue, FIFO queues

---

- LEDs share rows and columns
  - ~ The off-diagonal LEDs are residually turned on, in the demo
- ~ Operations are serialised, that's the whole idea
- ~ If mutex is timed out, the critical region code is effectively skipped.
- `__disable_irq()` and `__enable_irq()` is wrapped only when dealing with the critical region code, and not the while mutex code
