\section*{Question 1}

While debugging my code, I found that variable x was getting overwritten somewhere.
I did not know where, so I wrote the following function to write its value in a buffer, along with a timestamp.
\lstinputlisting[language=C, frame=single, linewidth=\linewidth]{../Codes/q1.c}
The function \texttt{get\_time\_in\_usec} returns the value of a 32-bit timer, which counts the number of 1 \( \mu \texttt{s} \) ticks since the timer was initialized. \\
It worked fine in my standalone code.
But once I start using it in a multitasking system from different tasks and ISRs, the logged values were often inconsistent.

    \item Can you explain why?
    \item And what should be done to fix?
