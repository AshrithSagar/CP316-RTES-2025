\subsection*{Question 4}

Why are there two stacks?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The main task (running \texttt{main}) requires one stack, and the created task (running \texttt{task1}) needs a separate stack.
Each task has its own execution context, including a stack for function calls, local variables, and saved register states.
