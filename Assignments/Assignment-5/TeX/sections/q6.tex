\subsection*{Question 6}

Explain \texttt{task\_create} code.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The function \texttt{task\_create} initializes a new stack for the created task.
It prepares the hardware context frame to mimic what the CPU expects on an exception.
It manually saves registers \texttt{R4} to \texttt{R11} and stores the stack pointer in \texttt{task\_sp[1]} for future use.
