\subsection*{Question 2}

How is \texttt{SVC\_Handler} called?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The function \texttt{SVC\_Handler} is invoked by executing the Supervisor Call (\texttt{SVC}) instruction in \texttt{task\_yield}.
\begin{verbatim}
void task_yield(void) { __asm("svc 0"); }
\end{verbatim}
This triggers a software interrupt, transferring control to \texttt{SVC\_Handler}.
