\subsection*{Question 3}

\texttt{SVC\_Handler} does not use any of \texttt{R4}-\texttt{R11}.
Why are they still pushed and popped?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

Although \texttt{SVC\_Handler} does not use \texttt{R4}-\texttt{R11} directly, these registers, known as \textit{callee-saved registers}, must still be saved and restored.
If a function or interrupt handler uses them, it must be responsible for saving and restoring their values.
Since the CPU does not save them automatically, the OS must manually push them before switching tasks and restore them afterward.
