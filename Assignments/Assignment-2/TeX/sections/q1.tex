Timing measurements

Program SysTick with a maximum reload value of \hex{0x00FFFFFF} and use CVR for timing measurements.

Measure the following:
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*), noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
    \item Function-call and loop overheads, and clock cycles per iteration in \texttt{delay\@()} function.
    \item Time spent to transmit one character.
    \item Average human reaction-time to click (press and release) a button.
\end{enumerate}

You may experiment with different loop sizes, multiple characters and mutliple switch presses to arrive at a ``reasonably'' accurate result.
