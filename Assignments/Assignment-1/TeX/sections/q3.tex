\section*{Question 3}

Understanding header files:
Add the following line in `build.sh`:
\begin{verbatim}
$CC -E $CFLAGS main.c > main.i
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item What does `\texttt{-E}' do?
    \item How many lines are there in \texttt{main.i}? Where did these lines come from?
    \item Functions in \texttt{myled.h} are defined as \texttt{static inline}.
          What does \texttt{static inline} mean?
\end{itemize}
