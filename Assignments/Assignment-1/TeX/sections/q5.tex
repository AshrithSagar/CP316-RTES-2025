\section*{Question 5}

Where are \texttt{.text}, \texttt{.rodata}, \texttt{.data} and \texttt{.bss} sections located, in flash or RAM?\@
Why?

\subsection*{Solution}

In \texttt{bare.ld} file defines where the sections need to be placed in the memory, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:sections}.
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{p{2cm} p{2cm} p{10cm}} \toprule
        \textbf{Section}  &
        \textbf{Location} &
        \textbf{Reason}
        \\ \midrule
        \texttt{.text}    &
        Flash             &
        The \texttt{.text} section contains the executable machine code (the program instructions), which typically doesn't change during runtime.
        \\
        \texttt{.rodata}  &
        Flash             &
        The \texttt{.rodata} section contains the read-only data, which typically doesn't change during runtime.
        \\
        \texttt{.data}    &
        RAM               &
        The \texttt{.data} section contains the variables that are initialized, which can be modified during runtime.
        \\
        \texttt{.bss}     &
        RAM               &
        The \texttt{.bss} section contains the uninitialized variables, which can change during runtime.
        It is zero-initialized during the program startup by the \texttt{crt\_init\@()} function.
