\section*{Question 8}

What is a vector table?
In which file would you find it?

\subsection*{Solution}

A vector table is a table of function pointers that contains the addresses of the various exception and interrupt service routines.
Upon an exception or interrupt, the microcontroller jumps to the corresponding address in the vector table to execute the appropriate handler.
The vector table is present in the startup file \texttt{startup.c}.
