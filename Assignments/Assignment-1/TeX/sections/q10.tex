\section*{Question 10}

What is the stack used for?
What is its size?
In which file is it reserved?

\subsection*{Solution}

The stack is used for various purposes, such as storing local variables, function arguments, return addresses, and other temporary data.
The stack size is defined in the \texttt{startup.c} file, in the following line:
\begin{verbatim}
#define STACK_SIZE  8192
\end{verbatim}
The stack is reserved in the \texttt{bare.ld} file, as shown below:
\begin{verbatim}
.stack :
{
    . = ALIGN(8);   /* initial sp should be 8-byte aligned */
    __stack_start_ = .;
    *(.stack*)
    __stack_end_ = .;
} > SRAM
\end{verbatim}
The stack is placed at the end of the RAM memory, with a size of 8192.
