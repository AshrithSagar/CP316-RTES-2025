Total how many object files are generated in the code given here?

\subsection*{Solution}

An object file is a file that contains the compiled code of a single source file.
It is generated by the compiler and contains the machine code for the source file.
The object file is not executable and needs to be linked with other object files to create an executable file.
The object file has a \texttt{.o} extension.
There are 4 object files generated in the code given here, namely \texttt{startup.o}, \texttt{system.o}, \texttt{main.o}, and \texttt{uart.o}.
