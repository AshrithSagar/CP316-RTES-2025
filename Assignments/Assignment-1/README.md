# ex1 tiny

Here, we will install the tool-chain and write "hello, world!" program using a minimal system.

The objectives are:

- Run your first program using command-line environment
- Understand how the toolchain works
- The structure of a program: vector table, startup code, main code and various data sections
- You can `untar` the content of the attached `ex1-tiny.tgz` by:

    ```bash
    tar xvfz ex1-tiny.tgz
    ```

Details are in README.
