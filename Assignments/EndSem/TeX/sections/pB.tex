\section*{Part B}

Describe synchronization mechanisms for the following:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
    \item Receiving audio samples
    \item Receiving echo pulse for the ultrasonic sensor
    \item Sending debug messages over the radio link.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsubsection*{Acquisition of audio samples}

This is a classic producer-consumer problem, where the producer is the \texttt{ADC ISR} that acquires the audio samples, and the consumer is the black box voice command detection algorithm that processes these samples.
The 16-bit ADC fires interrupts at \( 8\,\texttt{kHz} \), after which a minimally blocking \texttt{ADC ISR} writes these samples to a shared buffer.
Once a full window is available, the \texttt{ISR} can then use a semaphore to signal the processing task that a window is ready.
The producer adds in data to the buffer, while the consumer removes (and processes) them, and we ensure that both deal with full and empty buffers accordingly, i.e., the producer can't add more data to a full buffer, and the consumer can't remove data from an empty buffer.

\subsubsection*{Ultrasonic echo measurements}

A timer callback periodically triggers the trigger pin of the ultrasonic sensor to send out a pulse by keeping it high for a short duration.
The \texttt{uSonic ISR} records the timestamp of the rising and falling edges  of the ultrasonic sensor's echo pin.
After receiving the falling edge, the \texttt{ISR} signals a task using a semaphore to perform the distance calculation accordingly.
Recording the timestamps is time-critical, as is done in the \texttt{ISR}, while the distance calculation task takes lower priority, and this way of structuring allows for a small footprint in the \texttt{ISR}, while the distance calculation is offloaded to another task.

\subsubsection*{Transmission of debugging messages}

For the debug link, we can use a message queue to synchronise multiple producer tasks with a single consumer task.
Each of the producer tasks can enqueue the debug messages to the message queue, and the consumer task can dequeue these messages and send them over the radio link periodically.
The \texttt{RTOS} message queue implementation internally handles blocking and synchronization, so the producer tasks can block if the queue is full, and the consumer task can block if the queue is empty.
