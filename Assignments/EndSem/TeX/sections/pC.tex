\section*{Part C}

Define the memory management scheme for the audio buffers, using statically or dynamically allocated buffers.

\subsection*{Solution}

The \texttt{16}-bit ADC fires interrupts at \( 8\,\texttt{kHz} \), which gives one sample per interrupt.
The given black box voice command detection algorithm processes windows of \texttt{32\,ms} of these samples and writes them to a buffer.
Once there is enough data in the buffer to process, the algorithm is able to make a decision, which in this case is given as requiring 4 consecutive windows.
Since the samples are no longer required after passing the window, using a \textit{circular buffer} here to store the samples makes sense.
Naively allocating the buffer length to be 4 times the number of samples in one window should work, but since it is given that the algorithm executes in about \texttt{8\,ms}--\texttt{12\,ms}, which is less than \texttt{32\,ms}, so it sufficies to keep the length of this buffer to be twice the number of samples in one window.
The length required for such a buffer can then be calculated as \( 2 \times 8\,\cancel{\texttt{kHz}} \times 32\,\cancel{\texttt{ms}} = 512 \).
