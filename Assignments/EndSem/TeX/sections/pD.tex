\section*{Part D}

Identify any shared resources and specify if they need protection.

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Audio Buffers:

            Indices swapped under interrupt-disable; access by AudioProc guarded by semaphore.

      \item RTOS Queues:

            Audio command queue and debug queue are thread-safe FIFO structures provided by RTOS.\@

      \item Radio Interface:

            Protected by a mutex within driver layer to serialize DMA-driven or interrupt-driven transmissions.

      \item Global Variables (e.g., distanceCm):

            Written in ISR, read in Control Task; access synchronized via \texttt{echoSem} to ensure visibility and ordering.
\end{itemize}
