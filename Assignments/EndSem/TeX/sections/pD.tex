\section*{Part D}

Identify any shared resources and specify if they need protection.

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
          The audio sample buffers are a shared resource between the \texttt{ADC ISR} and the voice command detection task.
          Since we are using a double buffering scheme, there is no need for any additional protection here since at a given time only one of them accesses either of the buffers.
    \item
          The timestamp values captured by the \texttt{uSonic ISR} are later used by the distance calculation task.
          No additional protection is need here.
    \item
          The debug message queue is a shared resource among the multiple tasks that log debug messages as well as the single consumer task that sends these messages over the radio link.
          The message queue implementation provided by the RTOS handles internal protection using semaphores, so no explicit protection is needed by the application here.
          From an internal perspective, there is a need for protection to ensure that the queue is not accessed by multiple tasks at the same time.
\end{itemize}
