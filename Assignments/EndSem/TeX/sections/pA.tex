\section*{Part A}

Draw the block diagram of the system that includes the functional blocks (ISRs, timer callbacks and tasks). \\
Define the priorities of tasks. \\
Periodicity of the timer callbacks. \\
Indicate which ISR or task is interfaced with which hardware.
Draw the data flows:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
    \item Between the hardware and the functional block
    \item Between two functional blocks
\end{itemize}
